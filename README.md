# React Plot
ðŸ“‰ library for React.

# Why?
To learn more about SVG after coming across resources showing the simplicity,
elegance and power of SVG. The most fun ones were [How to be a compiler with JavaScript](https://medium.com/@kosamari/how-to-be-a-compiler-make-a-compiler-with-javascript-4a8a13d473b4)
and playing around with [Elm Plot](https://terezka.github.io/elm-plot/).
